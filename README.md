To get the binary for libssh2 from Microsoft, you can follow these steps:

Visit the official Microsoft vcpkg repository on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
Clone the vcpkg repository to your local machine using Git or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the vcpkg repository.
Run the following command to install libssh2 using vcpkg:
Copy code./vcpkg install libssh2
This command will download and build the libssh2 library using vcpkg.
Once the installation is complete, you can find the libssh2 binary and header files in the following directories:

On Windows:

Binary: vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin
Header files: vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\include


On macOS and Linux:

Binary: vcpkg/installed/x64-osx/lib or vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/lib
Header files: vcpkg/installed/x64-osx/include or vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/include



Note: The actual paths may vary based on your system and the version of vcpkg you are using.
To use libssh2 in your project, you need to link against the libssh2 library and include the necessary header files in your source code. You can refer to the vcpkg documentation for instructions on how to integrate vcpkg with your build system or IDE.

By using vcpkg, you can easily obtain the pre-built binary for libssh2 from Microsoft's repository, which can save you the effort of manually building the library from source.
Remember to choose the appropriate triplet (e.g., x64-windows, x64-osx, x64-linux) based on your target platform when installing libssh2 with vcpkg.
